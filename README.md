# Towards Improving Unit Commitment Economics: An Add-On Tailor for Renewable Energy and Reserve Predictions

Following are the dataset and the codes for the paper entitled "Towards Improving Unit Commitment Economics: An Add-On Tailor for Renewable Energy and Reserve Predictions" by Xianbang Chen, Yikui Liu, and Lei Wu.

We believe it is meaningful and helpful to enable the code open-access. So we upload the codes here. It requires MATLAB as the platform, GUROBI as the solver, and YALMIP to call GUROBI.

The methods of TPO, CPO, TRO, and TSP are stored in the folder "CPO_v10". The NN-based method is in the folder "CPO_Response".

If you are interested in our data, case studies, and codes, please feel free to contact me at xchen130@stevens.edu. It's my pleasure to share them with you. ðŸ¤¨
