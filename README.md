# Bilevel MIP-based CPO

The followings are the dataset and the codes for the paper entitled "Towards Improving Operation Economics: A Bilevel MIP-Based Closed-Loop Predict-and-Optimize Framework for Prescribing Unit Commitment" by Xianbang Chen, Yikui Liu, and Lei Wu.

To show our modifications on IEEE 118-bus system, we plot a map. Just check it out! [fig05.pdf](https://github.com/asxadf/CPO_for_Electricity_Market/files/9438507/fig05.pdf)

We believe it is meaningful and helpful to enable the code open-access. So we upload the codes here. It requires MATLAB as the platform, GUROBI as the solver, and YALMIP to call GUROBI.

If you are interested in our data, case studies, and codes, please feel free to contact me at xchen130@stevens.edu. It's my pleasure to share them with you. ðŸ¤¨
